With assignment number 2 I didn't have any issues with the javascript itself, but had some when I was reformating my site. I ended up changing codes so I could properly change to the secondary index in homework 2 where my second index.html was, the difficulty I was having the same as the previous assignment when assigning the background image. After experimenting and deleting code that didn't do anything anymore, I managed to get it to work.
