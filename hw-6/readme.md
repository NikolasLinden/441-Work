I managed to get this assignment actually completed without too much help. Taking the last assignment, I took the format and managed to fully configure it to keep the inputs from the first index, record what happened on the second, and display everything in the third. I did think the number of attempts in the assignment meant how many times the game itself was played, but I had already done the actual assignment part when I made the JavaScript record the number of wrong selections in the game.
