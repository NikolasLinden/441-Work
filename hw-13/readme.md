This project for me was tricky since I lost a lot of time due to other classes and some family issues that came up. At first I tried creating a type of forest with a sun and moon type of day/night cycle, and then when I couldn't get that to work I tried making a solar system, however I couldn't get textures to load onto a moon I had set up as the model in the center. It was kind of small, but I managed to edit the shapes down in size to be a little more appropriate and edited the camera zoom point to make the model seem a bit bigger. In the end, I figured out how to make the lighting and the objects spin thanks to looking at the example, but I never figured out how to make textures load, or how to change the shapes into spheres. I did however end up making the second one attached to the first shape look like a hotdog, so I settled for that. At some point I'd like to learn how to properly attach textures to the model, but right now I just haven't been able to figure it out.

I also got the model to only work in local files, but for whatever reason the model of the moon doesnt load via github.
