After the last assignment, I found this one a little easier to understand. The biggest hurdle in this was the moving structures, which I still didn't manage to get to work perfectly. still, using separate intervals I got them to fade in and out while circling around in a square, albeit not perfectly. Using the constructor, I added in those and two images and paragraphs to toggle between each other when the button was pushed, and although they didn't match up at first I switched the two around so the paragraph would match the picture.

On a side note, I normally just add each assignment to the navbar, but I didn't do this one because it's just getting really crowded up there.
