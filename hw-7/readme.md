This was easily the most challenging assignment yet, but after today I've finally seen what was probably my biggest problem. I didn't see the class feature correctly, as I was trying to assign the objects in a way that I wasn't supposed to. With a lot of help I managed to understand how the objects were created, loaded into the constructor, and finally gotten into the class with get. After that it was just seeing how my toString function was redundant, that I actually needed two objects (pictures in this case) for the class to decode instead of just trying to go line by line displaying them, and then loading them properly inside the html.
