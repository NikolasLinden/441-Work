In this assignment, we were supposed to pull out a dataset onto a webpage using jquery and ajax. At first, I somewhat succeeded using a .load to bring the data in, but it was in its raw form. With a lot of help, I learned I needed to use .getJSON instead and after even more trial, error, and help in getting everything to display I settled with learning how to project the entire data correctly instead of switching to a new set of the data per click. This was done by assigning a new object inside the jquery. finally, I managed to figure out how to apply a fade in and fade out function in a roundabout way of creating a new jquery to house everything in with the function attatched to it. Overall, this assignment was TOUGH, but I'm glad to have learned from it.
