This Assignment was a little difficult for me to finish. I had issues getting the buttons on the index to work, but the issue turned out to be a few coding mistakes in the javascript and the fact that I had the buttons in the same Div as the paragraph where the adventure's text came in. I'm not terrible sure why it didnt work, but I was honestly afraid to touch it anymore. Beyond that I understood how the javascript itself worked, assigning the different tags in it to be loaded up by the buttons using the attatched ids, changing depending on what "if" or "else if" was present on the buttons at the time.
