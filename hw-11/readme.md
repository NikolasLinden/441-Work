Collision is definitely a confusing part of java, but even without getting it to fully work right I know mostly whats going wrong. In this assignment part of the task was to "collect" objects from an array with a moving object, and in this case I used a splice in order to remove the objects once they collided. However, I believe that doing them out of order removes the entirety of the array when you collect one that's further down the order. I attempted to make it so that the one moves was the one collided by itself, but I couldn't quite get that to work. I also had the moving object completely stop working when it touched a fourth object for a reason I couldn't figure out, and the score itself kept subtracting 4 unless the object was touching one of the objects in the array, in which case it worked oddly enough. To somewhat remedy most of these, I labeled the objects in the array using ctx in the order that it does work, and labeled the last object as an ending point, kind of creating a little game.
