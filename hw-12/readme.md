This project was pretty straight forwards, use the guide given to us and then work on it from there. In this assignment, I chose to change the characters sprite, add more platforms, change the gravity of the stars, switch the jump from up to space, and add a level counter. The character sprite was probably the hardest part as I couldn't seem to find or edit a sprite to match the one given, but I did find one that just made the character a solid rectangle. I stuck with it since it reminded me of one of the blocks from the "Thomas was Alone" game. For the platforms it was pretty easy, just copy and paste one of the others and edit it to my liking. I changed the gravity of the stars by increasing their bounce, which seems to make them bounce differently at random, some of them not even ever settling which I kind of liked. The jump one was fairly easy too, just go in and swap the up key for space. However, the level counter took me a while to get working, and even then it starts at zero and jumps to 2, though it seems to go up only 1 level from there and just works.
