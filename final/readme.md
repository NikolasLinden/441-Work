I used the previous project we had done as a base. I originally wanted to do a solar system, but I had a lot of trouble getting the textures to load. Instead I opted to do the rotational are piece it is now. Unfortunately, I have a lot of issues with lag while its running atm, and while I wanted to add more moving pieces, it became too laggy for anything else to be added, so I had to cut it down. Still, I moved the original centerpiece for the geometry objects inside the model that's supposed to be a moon, so it's hidden, and having the outside items rotate give them a more smooth appearance, though for whatever reason the moon model doesn't show up in github, but works fine on the local server. It kind of looks like something you'd see a neuron be, so that's the design I went after in the end.
