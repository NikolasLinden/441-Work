I definitely had trouble with this one. Getting a lot of help, the order and naming of the functions properties threw me for a real loop. I did manage to get it done, but I probably spent three times the time I should have on this. Essentially, I did five input functions that all return an input to the console, with the fifth function changing the image and allowing for the loop of the game or to have it stop, which triggers a while to post the ending. This was certainly a challenge, but I'm glad to have learned from it.
