As a refresher for code, this was definitely a good assignment. In this assignment, I used an old assignment from a previous class as a template, and had to go through and edit it to fit my needs. I had issues with adding a background image, but thanks to the teacher's help I managed to learn how to do so and learned some other ways to do it through classmates. Essentially, for this assignment I successfully took an older set of code and changed it to what I needed, setting the css straight and formatting an older website to serve what I needed, changing a full dropdown menu to just a heading and changing paragraph divs to not only look better, but serve the purpose for this assignment.
