This project was a little tough, especially since I actually had less time to work on it with my parents in town to visit me. All in all, I got the majority of the assignment working. The blocks used if functions and both changed the color of the background and the size of the objects themselves, and with the second object it moved around randomly at 6000 intervals. I originally tried setting up a loop in the audio in the javascript, but ended up being able to embed controls in the index with the autoplay tag after controls. The only thing I couldn't figure out is why the object I moved around kept compounding the distance it moved. it would work well and be visible for the first few key clicks, but the movement just kept getting bigger and eventually ended up off the screen, which I believe also messed up the boundary function for that object.
