This week I didn't have too much trouble sorting out this assignment. I had everything right besides a few spelling mistakes, but the biggest issue I faced was the fact I labeled the function managing the "onlick" was wrong. I used the term "click" for the tag, which confused my HTML document since that is a function itself. All in all, I managed to get the assignment done and stylized properly. I've got the array of ten images, randomizing themselves every time using a while function with math, to load the page and allowing to attempt matching them. I chose pictures of famous buildings or mountains, mostly because I couldn't think of anything else to use at the time.
